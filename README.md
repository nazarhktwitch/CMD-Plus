19) Runs a file: 𝐫𝐮𝐧 "𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐡" (𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐡 𝐢𝐧 𝐪𝐮𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐧𝐥𝐲)

Note: The program does not like the Cyrillic alphabet, so if you go to delete a file named in Russian, you will have to rename it.


Note (OLD): I don't know why, but antivirus (Microsoft Defender) blocks the first release (CMDPlus v0.1) of this program and gives a trojan. Try to allow it and if necessary add the program to exceptions.
