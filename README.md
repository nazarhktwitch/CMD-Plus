# CMD-Plus
CMD PLUS is designed to streamline your command line operations with intuitive commands and helpful features, making it an indispensable tool for both beginners and advanced users.

Type any of the available commands followed by the required parameters, if any, and press Enter.

Example command usage:

1) Get Help: Type help to see the list of available commands and their descriptions.
2) Listing Files: list (List of files in CURRENT DIRECTORY, to change directory use cd command)
3) Creating a Directory: mkdir your\path\here\NAME OF DIRECTORY HERE
4) Changing Directory: cd your\path\here
5) Copying a File: cp your\path\from your\path\to
6) Deleting a File: rm your\path\here
7) Showing Current Directory: pwd
8) Exiting CMD PLUS: exit

Note: I don't know why, but antivirus (Microsoft Defender) blocks the program and gives a trojan. Try to allow it and if necessary add the program to exceptions.

Note 2: The program does not like the Cyrillic alphabet, so if you go to delete a file named in Russian, you will have to rename it.
